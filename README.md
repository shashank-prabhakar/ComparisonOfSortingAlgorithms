Steps:
• Download the repository
• Change the directory to the one containing the files you downlaoded. Or just drag and drop that folder onto Terminal.
• Compile the implemenatation file "gcc session7_impl.c -c"
• "gcc session7_client.c session7_impl.o -o sort.out"
• Feed the sort object with input from any of the files and write them to an output file"
  "./sort.out<input1.txt>output.txt
 
 
 A text file with the time of execution for all inputs is also attached.
